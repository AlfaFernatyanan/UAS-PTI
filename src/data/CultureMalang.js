        title: "Beskalan Putri Dance",
        description: "Tari Beskalan Putri. Originating in the 1930s alongside the flourishing Ludruk performances, this dance was initially performed by men dressed as women but is now also performed by women. Similar to the Tari Ngremo, the Malangan style of Ngremo Putri is unique, particularly in its costume, which combines elements from Gambyong and Malangan mask dances. The dancers wear traditional attire, including a kemben, selendang, and white socks, and their movements are dynamic yet graceful. Originally accompanied by simple instruments like the jidor, it is now performed with a full Javanese gamelan orchestra. Initially a street performance and a prelude to Ludruk shows, Tari Beskalan Putri is still performed today, sometimes to welcome guests, and it is suggested that Malang's government should promote it as an official welcome dance due to its cultural significance.",

        title: "Bantengan's Art",
        description : `Bantengan, derived from Ponorogo's Kebo-keboan art that grows in Malang, originated as a ritual to protect King Paku Buwana II of Surakarta. Martial artists from Mojokerto, Malang, and Batu adapted it to use a bull, an endangered local species, promoting Pencak Silat. Influenced by Malangâ€™s Candi Jago reliefs, early Bantengan used buffalo horns, but post-2000, bull horns became common with internet access. Some still use buffalo horns to honor the tradition. The black-and-red costumes resemble Ponorogo's traditional attire. Bantengan, initially popular in Mojokerto, Malang, and Batu, is now also preserved in Jombang and Kediri.`,
