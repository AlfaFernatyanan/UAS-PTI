        description: "Rujak Soto is a signature dish from Banyuwangi, East Java, Indonesia. It's a unique fusion of vegetable salad (rujak) with soto, which can be either beef soto or tripe soto. Some variations include chicken soto or chicken feet soto, often chosen when beef prices are high. Typically, the salad is served first and then topped with soto broth and its meat. The flavor is distinct, combining elements of soto with the tangy taste of rujak and the aroma of petis (shrimp paste). Rujak Soto is sometimes served with temulawak iced drink",
